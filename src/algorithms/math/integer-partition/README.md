# Integer Partition

In number theory and combinatorics, a partition of a positive 
integer `n`, also called an **integer partition**, is a way of 
writing `n` as a sum of positive integers. 

Two sums that differ only in the order of their summands are 
considered the same partition. For example, `4` can be partitioned 
in five distinct ways:

```
4
3 + 1
2 + 2
2 + 1 + 1
1 + 1 + 1 + 1
```

The order-dependent composition `1 + 3` is the same partition
as `3 + 1`, while the two distinct 
compositions `1 + 2 + 1` and `1 + 1 + 2` represent the same 
partition `2 + 1 + 1`.
