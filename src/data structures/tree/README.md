# Tree

In computer science, a tree is a widely used abstract data 
type (ADT) — or data structure implementing this ADT—that 
simulates a hierarchical tree structure, with a root value 
and subtrees of children with a parent node, represented as 
a set of linked nodes.

A tree data structure can be defined recursively (locally) 
as a collection of nodes (starting at a root node), where 
each node is a data structure consisting of a value, 
together with a list of references to nodes (the "children"), 
with the constraints that no reference is duplicated, and none 
points to the root.
